Some assumptions of the alternative model are that both sample populations (group with 'prestige' 1 or 2 vs group with 'prestige' 3 or 4) have the same variance and all samples are drawn independently of each other. Some risks of the alternative model are that the definition of 'prestige' of the undergraduate schools can be very subjective and may not be a good reflection of the quality of education in those schools which in turn distorts the perception on the qualification of the students from those schools, the number of sample points in each category is quite different and both samples might fall under a threshold (in terms of number of sample points) to accurately represent the respective underlying populations, the assumptions of the alternative model (mentioned earlier in the answer to question 3) might be violated."
